  - '1. The table lists the schools and designated centres that offer Higher Mother
    Tongue Language [HMTL i.e. Higher Chinese Language (HCL or hcl), Higher Malay
    Language (HML or hml) and Higher Tamil Language (HTL or htl)].'
  - '2. Students taking HMTL will attend lessons at their own secondary school during
    curriculum time, if the school offers it (schools denoted by “Yes” under the language
    offered in table). Otherwise, they will attend lessons in a designated centre
    outside curriculum time (schools denoted by “Yes” under the respective language
    designated centres).'
  - '3. Secondary schools have the flexibility to allow students who do not meet the
    criteria to take up HMTL to do so, if such students are assessed to have exceptional
    ability in MTL and are able to do HMTL without affecting their performance in
    other subjects.'
  - '4. For Independent Schools, parents should refer to the individual school pages
    in Reference K of the Secondary Schools booklet (accessible at www,moe.gov.sg/s1-posting)
    or contact the schools directly for information on school-based programmes/subjects
    that they might be offering.'
